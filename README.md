# Introduction 

Herein we aim to design a new rapid whole system change on a global scale using new relevant sustainability metrics (such as the Planetary Boundaries (PBs) framework) in a data-driven fashion. Aiming to clearly identify social tipping points using behavioural mechanisms.


# Pipeline for computing Global Boundaries (GBs) (Environmental, Social, Culltural and Economic) 

Global Boundaries are thersholds defined on the global scale, yet they are operational on the local scale (city scale). the GBs framework aim to (i) Defind the sub-Global Boundaries (ii) Compute each sub-Global Boundary at city scale, (iii) Trigger social tipping points using "Behavouiral mecanisms".   

Defining the Global Boundaries (GBs) is a three step process (phases). 
Herin I represent the main skeleton 

## Phase 0: DATA Curration
Data curration processus can be established using two main options. 

## Option 0: Collectiong real data 

Collecting real data is a very hard task to do on the planetary scale, it recommends to have a data collection process in each city, worldwide. I do not recommend to use this option (we don't know what data we can recieve at which forme, and it's quality). 

    * Collecting data 
    * Data mining 
    * Data enegineering 
    * Data inspection 

## Option 1: Generating synthetic data  

Generating synthetic data on city scale, worldwide, is a very intressting trajectory, espacially, for cities where data is confidential or inexistant. Yet, using synthetic data can be apprehended by three main tasks (here we know what we want,  data we can generate at which forme, and it's quality). 

    * Develop a scalable algorithme to generate data on planetary scale for each sub-boundary 
    * Make sure that the data is representative 
    * Production and deployment 

## Phase I: Generating the OUTPUT   

For this work we need an ethical approach: 

Global rapide system change can be ligitime only by expanding the Planetary Boundaries (PBs) framework to other limites (namely: social, economic and cultural). Using the term of Global Boundaries (GBs) instead of Planetary Boundaries (PBs) which can be a misleading concept. 

### Social Boundaries
Need to be determined in a holistic~regional fashion.
We need to define what are the social boundaries. Social Boundaries can be approahced by social variables such as: 

    * Gender equality 
        * Gender (male, female, LGBTQ+)
        * Working gender (cross profission: politics, education..etc) 
        * Respensibility & actions (who can be in charge)
        * Amunities (travel, tourism...etc) # who can travel without a visa for instance 
    * Demographique factors: 
        * Median age
        * Population growth rate 
        * Mariage age 
        * Household size
        * Relegion or Ethiest (we need to see who are the most respensable people)  
    * Energy consumption: 
        * Fossil fuels rate (%) 
        * Energy consumption/price  
        * Public transport network 
        * 
To be continued...

Ntice that social boundaries can be direven from the envronmental boundaries using the notion of "Planet Carrying Capacity", an algorithm must be developped and putten in place to automatise such task.  

### Cultural Boundaries 
Need to be determined in a localized fashion.

To be continued....

### Economical Boundaries 
Need to be determined in a holestic fashion.  

To be continued...

### Enviromental boundaries  
Need to be determined in-boundaries and out-boundries fashion. 

    * Set Planetary Baoundaries (already established, by the work of J. R and W. S) 
    * Set Planetary Baoundaries for each Country (donwscaling processus, as established for Switzerland, generalizability)
    * Set Planetary Baoundaries for each city
        * (i) Direct Planetary Baoundaries (DPBs)
            * Definign what is a "city"? 
                * Population 
                * Area 
                * Density 
                * ...

            *
            * Triggring social tipping points
                * Group by culture 
                * Group by Income 
        * (ii) Virtual Planetary Baoundaries (VPBs) 
            * comptuing upstream boundaries 

To be continued... 

## Phase II: using the OUPUT 

Using the output of 'Phase I' into a new AI pipileline to trigger social tipping points.

# Resources 

For this study we need data from: 

    * Eora 
    * EDGAR
    * WB
    * ...etc 

It is important to highlight that such work require the use of a cluster-computre. Do we have access to clusrter-computer?!!

# Vizualisation 

The output of this work is displying each city by a dounut (DE), divided into four sections following the Global Boundaries framework (enviromental, social, economic and cultural). In the figure downbelow we show one option on how to display results. 

add figure here!
